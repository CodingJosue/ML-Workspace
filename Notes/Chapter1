What is machine Learning ?

1.Machine learning is the science (and art) of programing computers so they can learn from data
2. A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure
P , if it's performance on T, improves with experience E

For instance a spam filter is a machine laerning program that, given examples of spam emails flagged by users and examples
of regular emails (non spam, also called "ham"), can learn to flag spam. The examples that the system uses to learn are
called the training set. Each training example is called a training instance (or sampe). The part of a machine learning
system that learns and makes predictions is called a model. Neural networks and random forests are examples of models.

In this case, the task T is to flag spam for new emails, the experience E is the training data , and the performance  p
needs to be define ; for example tou can use the ratio of correctly classified emails. This particular performance measure
is called accuracy, and it is often used in classification tasks.

Why use Machine Learning ?

Consider how would you write a spam filter using traditional programming techniques

1. first examine what spam typically looks like m might notice some words like 4u or credit card , free

2. write a detection algorithm that looks for these particular words .

3. lunch and test the program -> write new rules   if not sufficient enough (essentially the algorithm would become a
long list of rules )

the issue with that approach is first of all its not practical, to many rules second of all what if spammers notice all
their emails containing "4u" are blocked; then they might start using "For u" instead, now I would have to make this a
new rule. In contrast, a machine learning program will automatically notices that "For U" has becomes unusually frequent
in spam flagged by useers
